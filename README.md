# <div align="center">Valuation Packages

This is a personal repository for developing and experimenting with different valuation methods. Currently nothing here is complete or tested as working. If you find something useful here by all means use it but I can't guarantee anything, or offer support for more features. This is a free time project so timeline is non-existent.

### <div align="center">DCF Package

The idea here is to build out a fully-functional DCF package that is modular and overly generic rather than specific. This would allow for multiple methods of valuation and for switching out formulas based on new theories.

## <div align="center">Multiples Package

This package is all about multiples analysis for use in conjunction with other types of analyses.
