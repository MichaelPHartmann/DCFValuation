# Python DCF
### A Python-based project to automate discounted cash flow valuations.
---
As part of my journey of learning to code I wanted a project to practice on and implement new skills with. As I learn more and more programming this DCF package gets better and better.

## Current State & Goals
---

Currently the package is still being built. While working 'prototypes' of the various functions are finished, there is still lots of work to be done. Abstraction of various common calculations, the addition of classes to conserve data usage and implementing customizability are just a few of the immediate improvements in the works.

My goal is to eventually have a web-facing service that can run python on the backend. This service would be able to facilitate everything from simple to complex DCF calculations and would be able to export all information into .CSV or .XLS files. This service would also implement FinMesh elements to aid in screening and monitoring of market conditions.

Further down the line, algorithims and machine learning will assist in building, maintaining, and recommending financial portfolios based on value-investing principles.

Financial data is courtesy of IEX Inc. This trading platform offers affordable, fast, and reliable stock market data through it's API service. The FinMesh packaged developed by Josh Hartmann and myself uses this API as the backbone for it's financial information. Accounts are free and data is accessed through a personal API key.
