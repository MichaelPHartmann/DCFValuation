## Why is this different than FinMesh?
By making some of these things classes, it allows for:
- Additional statistics to be generated from the requested data
- Keeping track of the time when the requests were made (Useful when saving data)
- Idenitfying the exact request the produced the resulting data (Also useful when saving data)

## TODO
I originally was going to do way with finmesh but I realized I should have used it. The base class will need some changes
